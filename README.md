> Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Real Constitutional Documents with Grounded Citations

Hey! This is my RAG project — it answers questions about constitutions from 6 countries, always cites its sources, and refuses to make stuff up when it doesn't know the answer.

---

## 🤔 What is this?

I built this to solve a simple problem: LLMs hallucinate. They confidently make up facts that sound real but aren't. When you're dealing with constitutional law, that's a problem.

So this system:
1. Takes your question
2. Searches through real constitution PDFs
3. Finds the most relevant sections
4. Tells the LLM: "Answer using ONLY this, and cite everything"
5. If nothing relevant is found → "I don't have enough information"

No more guessing. No more fake citations.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Semantic search** — understands meaning, not just keywords
- 📄 **6 constitutions** — USA, France, Germany, Pakistan, Norway, Canada
- 🎯 **Forced citations** — every fact has `[Source: filename, Page: X]`
- 🚫 **No hallucinations** — refuses below similarity threshold
- 🖥️ **Streamlit UI** — clean web interface
- 🧪 **Tested** — pytest suite + 30-question evaluation
- ⚙️ **Configurable** — chunk size, threshold, model, all adjustable

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download) installed
- Visual C++ Redistributable ([Windows only](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe))
- ~4 GB RAM

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/constitutional-rag-qa.git
cd constitutional-rag-qa

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Activate (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Pipeline
```bash
# 1. Add PDFs to data/documents/

# 2. Ingest documents (load + chunk)
python src/ingest.py

# 3. Create embeddings + store in ChromaDB
python src/embed_store.py

# 4. Pull LLM model (in a separate terminal)
ollama pull llama3.1
ollama serve

# 5. Test retrieval
python src/retrieve.py

# 6. Test answer generation
python src/generate.py

# 7. Launch the UI
streamlit run app.py
```

## 💬 Example Queries
Try asking things like:

 - "What fundamental rights do citizens have?"
 - "How is the president elected?"
 - "What's the process to amend the constitution?"
 - "What emergency powers exist?"
 - "How are judges appointed?"

And out-of-scope questions like "What's the recipe for pizza?" will get refused.

## 📊 Evaluation
I wrote 30 test questions across 8 categories. The system measures:
 - **Hit rate** — did search find the right document? (target: ≥80%)
 - **Refusal rate** — does it refuse on unrelated questions? (target: ≥80%)
 - **Citation rate** — does every answer have sources?

```bash
python src/eval.py
```
